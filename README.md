# EasySync

An app for Mac users like graphic artists who work on large binary files
and need to maintain up-to-date copies in a second location.

It is designed with an emphasis on safety and convenience.

- Once activated, changed files are copied from the working directory to the sync directory.

- Changes made to the sync directory are not watched or copied to the working folder.

- Files you delete from the working directory are not deleted from the sync directory until you click the 'Cleaup: Delete files' button.

- The app saves its state for each user, so adding it to your login items will provide automatic continuity when you log in again.
